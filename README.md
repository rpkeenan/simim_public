SimIM
=====

SimIM is a tool for simulating the extra-galactic sky in radio, sub-mm and
far-infrared. Full documentation is available via [Read the
Docs](https://simim.readthedocs.io). Source code is avialable via
[GitHub](https://github.com/rpkeenan/simim_public).

This is Version 0.1, which includes only basic utilities for downloading and
formatting simulation data, adding new properties such as spectral line emission
to simulations, and visualizing basic data. Incremental releases will add
functionality building light cones, making data cubes or maps, and creating mock
timestreams.
