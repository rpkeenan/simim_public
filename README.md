SimIM
=====

SimIM is a tool for simulating the extra-galactic sky in radio, 
sub-mm and far-infrared. Full documentation is available via
[Read the Docs](https://simim.readthedocs.io).
Source code is avialable via [GitHub](https://github.com/rpkeenan/simim_public).

This is Version 0.0, which includes only basic utilities for 
downloading and formatting simulation data. Incremental releases will
add functionality for adding spectral line emission, calculating
statistical properties, building light cones, making data cubes
or maps, and creating mock timestreams.
