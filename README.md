SimIM
=====

SimIM is a tool for simulating the extra-galactic sky in radio, sub-mm and
far-infrared. Full documentation is available via [Read the
Docs](https://simim.readthedocs.io). Source code is avialable via
[GitHub](https://github.com/rpkeenan/simim_public).

This is Version 0.2, which includes utilities for downloading and formatting
simulation data, adding new properties such as spectral line emission to
simulations, visualizing basic data products, constructing light cones, and
making pixelized maps or data cubes. A future release will add more detailed
documentation with examples of all functionality and relevant scientific
applications. A module for creating mock timestreams is currently in
development.
